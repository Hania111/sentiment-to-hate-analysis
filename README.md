# Sentiment-to-hate-analysis
From Sentiment to Hate: Sentence-Level Emotion Classification and Hate Speech Detection in Machine Learning

# ðŸ“Š DistilBERT Sentiment Classification with Cross-Validation, Hyperparameter Tuning, and Statistical Analysis
## Project Overview
- Data loading
- Tokenization using Hugging Face's "AutoTokenizer"
- Training and evaluation of DistilBERT using `transformers.Trainer`
- Grid search over learning rate and batch size
- Collection of metrics: F1, accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix
- Friedman statistical tests to determine if hyperparameter tuning leads to statistically significant differences
## Requirements 
`pip install transformers datasets scikit-learn scikit-posthocs seaborn matplotlib`
## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The provided sentiment_dataset.csv contains tweets categorized into three classes:

0 â€“ Negative sentiment

1 â€“ Neutral sentiment

2 â€“ Hate speech

The class labels must be encoded as {0, 1, 2} because the CrossEntropyLoss function used in training expects integer class indices starting from 0 up to num_labels - 1.
